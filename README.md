# Design-and-Simulation-of-4-to-2-Encoder-3-to-8-Decoder-Circuits-using-Verilog-HDL
Designed and simulated a 4-to-2 encoder and 3-to-8 decoder using Verilog HDL. Implemented both modules using behavioral modeling and verified functionality through testbenches and waveform analysis. Reinforced core digital design concepts.
